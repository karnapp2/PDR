  title = {Modeling of {{Rocket Motor Ballistics}} for {{Functionally Graded Propellants}}},
  abstract = {Functionally Graded Solid Rocket Propellants are being developed at NSWC-Indian Head in conjunction with the University of Maryland. The approach being used treats these propellants as
typical Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs), which by definition are structures that possess gradual variations in material behavior that enhance material and/or structural performance. For functionally graded propellants, Twin Screw Extrusion (TSE) processing is used to continuously vary the composition throughout a grain in a controlled manner. As a result, TSE processing allows the burning rates of propellants to be tailored as a function of burning web thickness. This in turn will allow for direct Thrust Magnitude Control (TMC) for a solid rocket motor, which has proven difficult to achieve in the past.

To realize the benefits of functionally graded propellants in rocket motors, an Inverse Design Procedure (lOP) is being developed that couples processing, property, and performance models with mathematical optimization techniques to enable designers to determine realistic gradient architectures that will meet the performance objectives. An essential part of this program is the
development of a model that is capable of predicting the ballistic performance of functionally graded propellants. The development of such a model requires that new parameters be taken into account that would not be considered for a conventional solid propellant. For instance, not only will the burning rate change as a function of pressure and initial temperature, but the burning rate characteristics will also change as a function of position in the rain. Furthermore, the density and the thermochemistry associated with the graded architecture of the propellant will be
changing in a continuous manner, whereas the grain will conventionally be represented by a web with discrete thickness. The details of the ballistics model and the effect on performance
predictions related to discrete representations of continuously graded architectures will be discussed in the paper.},

  abstract = {The NATO Research and Technology Organization (RTO), Advanced Vehicle Technology (AVT), Working Group (WG) 016 (formerly AGARD/PEP Working Group \#27) undertook to evaluate methods in use within the NATO propulsion community to measure burning rate in solid propellant rocket systems, with the purpose of identifying similarities and differences between the participating nations. This WG was formed in 1996, consisting of active representatives from 6 of the 15 member nations of NATO, with inputs accepted from 4 other member nations and a couple non-member nations.

The NATO RTO/AVT WG 016 sought to contribute to improvements in the burning rate tools to address issues that have plagued the solid propulsion industry for over 40 years. This paper reviews the final results of this study by summarizing the objectives, approach, findings, and recommendations of this working group based on activity from October 1997 to March 2001. Recommendations are reviewed on direct and non-intrusive burning rate measurement methods, data analysis, and performance scaling to support improved prediction of internal ballistics of a full-scale solid propellant motor.

AVT WG 016 activities have identified that manufacturer burning rate data may not easily be compared without accounting for industry-wide differences in subscale devices, test methods and scaling analysis methods. The WG recommends the NATO propulsion community review these findings as a means of advancing their own burning rate measurement and analysis methods.},

  lccn = {AFOSR-TR-78-0060},
  abstract = {Augmentation of solid propellant burning rate often occurs in the presence of strong product gas flow across the burning surface: this phenomenon is referred to as erosive burning. Increasing use of motors with low port-to-throat area ratios (including nozzleless motors) is leading to increased occurrence and severity of erosive burning. A first generation model based upon bending of columnar diffusion flames by a crossflow, permitting prediction of the effect of high-velocity crossflow on the burning rate of a composite propellant given only the zero-crossflow burning rate characteristics, is briefly summarized and compared with data. A second generation model (still under development) which does not require even zero-crossflow burning rate data, using only composition and particle size as input, is outlined. In addition, a test device permitting extensive characterization of burning rate-pressure-crossflow velocity relationships for various propellants with direct continuous measurement of instantaneous burning rate by high-speed cinematography is described, and results of a series of tests with seven propellants are presented. These tests indicate that the first generation composite propellant erosive burning models reasonably good predictive capability, particularly in the higher pressure region, where the propellant combustion is dominated by the propellant heterogeneity In addition, the tests indicate no dependence of erosive burning on the temperature of the crossflow mainstream gases tending to cast serious doubt on models (such as the Lenoir-Robiliard model) which are based upon postulated augmented heat transfer from the main- stream crossflow gases. A model of aluminum particle combustion in CO2 which incorporates measured kinetic data for the gas phase reaction of aluminum with CO2 rather than assuming a flame-sheet (infinite gas-phase kinetics) as in past models has been developed, programmed and used to parametrically study the effect of various parameters on particle burning rate and burn-time. This model treats aluminum oxide condensation as occurring in an infinitesimally thin shell whose location is determined by specification of a condensation temperature. Condensation of aluminum oxide at the particle surface is not permitted, but Al2O produced by the gas-phase reaction of aluminum vapor with CO2 is permuted to react with infinite kinetics with aluminum liquid at the surface to form Al2O gas, thus removing aluminum from the surface as well as supplying heat to vaporize additional aluminum. Heat feedback from the condensation shell also provides additional energy for aluminum vaporization. Two variations of this model were developed: in one, any CO2 reaching the surface was permitted to react infinitely rapidly with aluminum liquid to produce Al2O gas, while in the other this reaction was prohibited. With the similarity approximations made in the model(s), the former vdriant leads to a degenerate solution in which the predicted burning rate is independent of the gas-phase kinetics, while the latter variant leads to burning rates predicted with the measured gas-phase kinetic data which are less than those predicted with infinite kinetics assumed. The ratio of burning rates predicted with the measured kinetic data to those predicted with infinite kinetics for the same conditions varies from about 0.3 to 0.95 over the range of conditions studied, increasing with increased particle size, increased pressure, decreased ambient CO2 mole fraction, and decreased ambient temperature. This ratio asymptotically approaches unity for large particle sizes and asymptotically approaches a value between zero and unity, which depends on ambient conditions at very small particle sizes (where the location of the condensation shell dominates relative to gas-phase kinetics). Burn time versus initial particle diameter calculations indicate a reduction in the exponent in the d\^n-burning law (d\_o\^2 - d\^2 = kt) from 2 for the case of infinite kinetics (diffusion-limited burning) to 1.35--1.90, depending on ambient conditions.},

  abstract = {The development of models to compute the burning rate of energetic materials has undergone a paradigm shift in the last 15 years from treating the gas-phase reactions as a few global reactions to attempting to describe all of the elementary reactions involved. This shift toward chemical specificity has brought the promise of true predictive capability in such models. Thwarting this promise, however, has been the unattainability of treating the condensed-phase and surface processes with commensurate detail and assurance. In this work, it is shown that limited predictability has recently been achieved by a semi- empirical finesse of the condensed-phase reactions and surface gasification through the agency of a universal pyrolysis law for certain families of propellant ingredients. It is also argued that the long-range prognosis for generalized predictability arising from a first-principles three-phase model lies with developing submodels for the condensed-phase and surface phenomena based on molecular dynamics (MD). However, since a continuum description of the gas-phase processes will always be preferable, the mating of these MD submodels with the continuum gas-phase description will be a non-trivial research issue. To facilitate the coming dialogue between current continuum modelers and future MD modelers, this work describes the conceptual and mathematical basis of the continuum models in considerable detail. It is suggested that the mating of these disparate descriptions might be accomplished by developing simple, idealized continuum submodels whose parameters and assumptions might be justified by the MD submodels. An example of such a continuum submodel is developed for the process of multicomponent evaporation as a surface-gasification mechanism.},

The test article motions, in general, conformed to those predicted by dynamics equations, in that the direction of movement observed was the same as that indicated by the dynamics equations, but the magnitude of motion did not agree precisely. As a result of this test series, it was concluded that satisfactory staging of the Atlas from the Centaur will occur, even if one of the eight retro rockets does not fire.

The linear-shaped charge, which cuts the interstage adapter during the separating sequence, successfully functioned in every test. The detonating train serving the shaped charge performed satisfactorily with the exception of marginal behavior noted in the functioning of a "safe and arm device" used to initiate the detonation.

The retrorocket system produced difficulties in that a number of misfires were encountered. The need for an improved igniter was indicated and a new design was obtained.},

  abstract = {New insights have been gained in atmospheric and space launch stage separation from our studies of the aerodynamic interference between multiple bodies in supersonic flow. Quick means of estimating and controlling repulsion or attraction lift associated with this interaction is an important enabling technology to size launch separation rocket motors to achieve the best compromise between motor weight and safe staging. In this connection, motor weight reduces usable payload. Asymptotic methods, scattering, slender body theories and CFD modeling have provided valuable systematic approximations schemes that advantageously couple with modern computational methods. Our theoretical solutions for lift force interference between multiple bodies give good agreement with numerical solutions and experimental data. These solutions shed light on important scattering phenomena not previously recognized a s relevant to this problem. The analyses allow us to identify lumped dimensionless parameters and provide scaling laws a s well as closed-form expressions for the interference not accessible solely from computation that can be used for interpolation andd extrapolation of CFD solutions as well as efficient testing and design of new flight vehicles. This approach dramatically simplifies trajectory predictions in which inertial and aerodynamic forces are strongly coupled. The aforementioned modeling has been carried out in the framework of the quasi-steady approximation. However, there are cases when acceleration of the body C.G. and/or the pitching angular velocity are not small and the unsteady effects become appreciable. First steps in mathematical modeling of these effects have been made with emphasis on the body wave drag. Namely, theoretical analysis of the wave drag generated by a non-lifting slender body of revolution during its instantaneous supersonic start was carried out. Typical phases of the transient process were identified. For each phase, analytical solutions of the flow potential and wave drag were obtained. The transient process was also simulated numerically by solving 3-D Euler equations. The theoretical wave drag is in excellent agreement with CFD in all phases of the transient process. These results provide a good launching pad for theoretical modeling of unsteady body motions including the coupling between body dynamics and aerodynamics.},

  abstract = {Interstage aerodynamic pressure that occurs during stage separation was investigated for a two-stage missile at a Mach number of 2.0 and an altitude of 38,000 feet in the NASA Lewis 8- by 6-foot supersonic wind tunnel. The model consisted of a wing-supported second stage having a cold-air simulated rocket motor operated at a constant total pressure, and a sting-supported, translating first stage. Separation distance was varied up to 3 second-stage body diameters. Effects of stage misalinement were studied by displacement of stage centerlines over a range up to 1 second-stage diameter. First- to second-stage diameter ratios were 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5.

First-stage interference effects produced higher-than-ambient second-stage base pressures over a longer separation distance for jet-off staging than for jet-on. First-stage ports for rocket-on staging reduced the distance of first-stage interference effects. Ports also reduced but did not eliminate fluctuating second-stage base and afterbody pressures that occurred at separation distances less than 1 diameter for rocket-on staging.},

Output are geared mainly to the wind-weighting procedure, and includes summary of trajectory at burnout, apogee and impact, summary of spent-stage trajectories, detailed position and vehicle data, unit-wind effects for head, tail and cross winds, coriolis deflections, range derivative, and the sensitivity curves (the so called F(Z) and DF(Z) curves).

The numerical integration procedure is a fourth-order, modified Adams-Basbforth Predictor-Corrector method. This method is supplemented by a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to start the integration at t = 0 and whenever error criteria demand a change in step size},

safe, reliable, testable, and maintainable code. Consequently, the rules contained in this document are required for Air Vehicle C++ development 1 and recommended for non-Air Vehicle C++ development.

As indicated above, portions of Air Vehicle (AV) code will be developed in C++. C++ was designed to support data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and generic programming
while retaining compatibility with traditional C programming techniques. For this reason, the AV Coding Standards will focus on the following:

1. Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA) Guidelines For The Use Of The C Language In Vehicle Based Software,
2. Vehicle Systems Safety Critical Coding Standards for C, and
3. C++ language-specific guidelines and standards.

The MISRA Guidelines were written specifically for use in systems that contain a safety aspect to them. The guidelines address potentially unsafe C language features, and provide programming rules to avoid those pitfalls. The Vehicle Systems Safety Critical Coding Standards for C, which are based on the MISRA C subset, provide a more comprehensive set of language restrictions that are applied uniformly across Vehicle Systems safety critical applications. The AV Coding Standards build on the relevant portions of the previous two documents with an additional set of rules specific to the appropriate use C++ language features (e.g. inheritance, templates, namespaces, etc.) in safety-critical environments.

Overall, the philosophy embodied by the rule set is essentially an extension of C++'s philosophy with respect to C. That is, by providing ``safer'' alternatives to ``unsafe'' facilities, known problems with low-level features are avoided. In essence, programs are written in a ``safer'' subset of a superset.},

The formulation was designed for the specific purpose of generating accurate fire control data for the ASROC missile but may have wide application among other types of rockets. For this reason certain terms have been included in the model which are not significant for the ASROC application. Among them are terms to simulate effects of a rotating earth.

  abstract = {This report describes a FORTRAN coded computer program and method for evaluation of the rigid body disturbing moments for a launch vehicle first stage based on post-flight measurements. The technique is a straightforward deterministic approach. Residual moments are computed to satisfy the equations of motion. Residuals are expressed also in terms of altered vehicle characteristics ; i.e., aerodynamic coefficients, thrust misalignment, and control effectiveness. This method has been used on the Scout Launch Vehicle for more than fifteen years and has uncovered several significant differences between flight data and wind tunnel data. 

The computer program is written in FORTRAN IV for a CDC CYBER 173 computer system. It has been used on IBM 7090, IBM 360/370 and CDC 6600 computer systems with minor modifications. A typical problem requires less than 20 seconds of running time on a CDC CYBER 173 computer system. The program and associated subroutines contain 1745 cards and requires (38K) words of memory.},

The estimated base drag reduction during base-burn motor functioning showed a very good correlation with time of flight and to a lesser degree with local atmospheric air pressure. No correlation was evident with flight Mach number, provided an effective base drag coefficient is assumed which is just a function of Mach number. This result suggests a simple addition to the Modified Point Mass Trajectory Model for the exterior ballistic simulation of the M864 base-burn projectile.},

  title = {Predicting the {{Accuracy}} of {{Unguided Artillery Projectiles}}},
  abstract = {A method for predicting the accuracy of unguided artillery projectiles is presented in this thesis. The goal was to develop a standalone program that would estimate accuracy without the need for a large database of weapon trajectory data. The presented method uses a simplified version of the modified point mass trajectory model and error computation models to predict error metrics that are particularly useful in predicting damage effects on various types of targets using the Joint Weaponeering System (JWS). The developed program is coded in Visual Basic, and the error metrics can typically be computed in less than 30 seconds for most ranges, in the computation precision specified in this thesis.

The program was verified by comparing it against the FT 155-AM-02 firing table for the M107(HE) 155mm artillery projectile. The verification results demonstrate that the developed trajectory model closely matches the basic trajectory data to within 2\% and ballistic partials to within 7\% for most ranges of interest. Accuracy metrics derived from the ballistic partials generated from the developed program are within 10\% of those derived from the firing table's ballistic partials for typical firing ranges. The model is able to take into account wind effects and varying levels of meteorological data staleness. The developed program is named the Indirect Fire Delivery Accuracy Program (IFDAP), and it can be used to predict
accuracies for any unguided projectile given the required aerodynamic coefficients, physical properties, and error budgets.},

The trajectory is the path that a projectile travels to the impact point, while the accuracy is the measurement of the deviation of the impact point from the target. In addition, this thesis describes, the methodology for calculating the various factors such as drag and drift in the trajectory calculation. A three degree of freedom model will be compared to a five degree of freedom model. With an accurate trajectory prediction, it is possible to calculate the delivery accuracy in a predicted fire, which does not have cumulative error corrections associated with the registration or adjusted fire. The delivery accuracies that are considered in this thesis are; 1) Mean
Point of Impact (MPI) that are related to aiming errors and 2) Precision errors that are related to the dispersion caused by ballistics effect. Finally, the trajectory and accuracy estimates are compared with NATO Armament Ballistics Kernel (NATO) and Joint Weapons Accuracy Model (JWAM) respectively, and the differences are of the order of 4 percent.},

A curve-fitting program then fit the revised equations to the trajectory data by adjusting the parameter values. Density, sound speed and wind profiles obtained from these fits were in excellent agreement with the original atmospheric data.

The tricyclic motion of a missile with misaligned control surfaces is briefly considered. This linear theory is, then, applied to the analysis of ballistic range data.

Next, simple cubic nonlinearities in static moment and Magnus moment are treated by a quasi-linear analysis and these cubic coefficients obtained from ballistic range flight data. More generalized relations for arbitrary symmetric nonlinear terms are derived and their use in the construction of "amplitude" planes indicated. These amplitude planes have proven to be quite useful for the prediction of missile flight performance. Finally, the influence of strongly nonlinear static moments is determined by a perturbation method which makes use of two quasi-constants of the motion -- total energy and angular momentum.},

In all cases of three-dimensional flow separation and reattachment, the assumption of continuous vector fields of skin-friction lines and external flow streamlines, coupled with simple laws of topology, provides a flow grammar whose elemental constituents are the singular points: the nodes, spiral nodes (foci), and saddles. The phenomenon of three-dimensional separation may be construed as either a local or a global event, depending on whether the skin-friction line that becomes a line of separation originates at a node or a saddle point. Adopting these notions enables us to create sequences of plausible flow structures, to deduce mean flow characteristics, to expose flow mechanisms, and to aid theory and experiment where lack of resolution in wind-tunnel observations or in the results from numerical computations causes imprecision in diagnosis.},

Body and wing geometries can be quite general in that pointed or blunt nose bodies and sharp or blunt leading edge wings can be assumed. Computed results for several configurations compare well with experimental and other analytical results. The computer program is cost effective as it costs less than ten dolars per Mach number to compute the lift, drag, pitching moment, magnus moment, roll damping moment, and pitch damping moment of a typical wing-body shape on the CDC 6700 computer. Thus, a reasonably accuracte dynamic stability analysis and performance estimates can be made for most tactical weapons up to Mach number 3 and angle of attack 15 deg, without wind tunnel tests. Future efforts will be directed towards increasing Mach number capability to 6, angle of attack to 180 deg, and incorporating air-breathing configurations into the analysis.},

  abstract = {NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Wallops Flight Facility (NASA/GSFC/WFF) has long utilized the White Sands Missile
Range (WSMR) as a key support element for the launch and recovery of sophisticated scientific instruments on high performance sounding rockets. The evolution of higher performance vehicles, increasingly limited launch opportunities,
ever narrowing flight corridors, growth in both uprange facilities and support personnel, and spiraling launch range support costs have necessitated a new approach to conducting launch operations at WSMR.

In response to these challenges, NASA/GSFC/WFF has recently introduced the Saab Space S19 Boost Guidance System (BGS) to their WSMR launch operations. This paper addresses the unique problems associated with launching the Black Brant V, VIII, and IX sounding rocket vehicles at WSYR and the significance of the introduction of the S19 to the NASA/GSFC/WFF sounding rocket program in terms of launch flexibility, improved impact dispersion, higher flight reliability, and reduced program costs.
This paper also discusses salient flight results from NASA 36.011UL (the first S19 guided Black Brant launched at WSMR) and the NASA Comet Halley missions (36.010DL and 36.017DL).},

successful test at Alamogordo and the building of the first electronic computer. Their combined impact was to modify qualitatively the nature of global interactions between Russia and the West. No less perturbative were the changes wrought in all of academic research and in applied science. On a less grand scale these events brought about a renascence of a mathematical technique known to the old guard as statistical sampling; in its new surroundings and owing
to its nature, there was no denying its new name of the Monte Carlo method.

This essay attempts to describe the details that led to this renascence and the roles played by the various actors. It is appropriate that it appears in an issue dedicated to Stan Ulam.},

The extension of the tables (originally developed for the US) to encompass the enlire Northern Hemisphere is discussed and the shortcomings of the current climatological regional zones described. New tables, based on current data and used for a more limited geographical area, are shown to be accurate to one half of one percent, hence furnish excellent back-up Information when a current sounding is not available for artillery firings. A procedure for minimizing ballistic density errors that accrue between observational periods is also presented.},

  abstract = {In the first decade of this century, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models were first used in an artillery meteorological (MET) system to produce MET messages. The development and testing of the new system required a means to generate MET messages from the NWP model output and produce the same types of messages from radiosonde-based data for test purposes. The Army has fielded 2 major upgrades since that first system, but the message generation methodology has remained much the same. The US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) developed and continues to update a generalized method to produce the several message types as well one or more user-defined ``messages.'' In its current form, the software can ingest from 2 to as many as 4000 observations, and can produce a vertical ``profile'' of nearly 4000 integrated mean layer values from the surface to the highest level of the height structure of the ``message.'' In this report, the primary methods are presented along with the major program routines in pseudo code and text, and samples of the input and output.},

  abstract = {The meteorological (MET) error budget tables for artillery list MET errors that are based on radiosonde observations (RAOBs) at various ``staleness'' increments. Staleness increments are in terms of time (e.g., ``30-min MET'') or equivalent distance from the RAOB launch site. The values in the tables represent levels of error extracted from extensive sets of RAOB data generated several decades ago. The US Army Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center asked for assistance to produce artillery MET error budget tables that account for expected errors when using MET model-based systems. Representatives of the US and other nations within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization expressed a need for shareable model-based MET error budgets. Use of an openly available civilian version of a MET model to generate the appropriate values will allow distribution without restrictions that could arise from extracting data from an operational military system. This investigation provides those model-based MET error budget values using an open-source version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The MET error budget tables are formatted similarly to traditional RAOBbased tables. Consequently, the transition to the model-based tables should not require any significant effort on the part of the user.},

  lccn = {ARL-TN-0550},
  abstract = {The armed forces of many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members and other nations have used ballistic meteorological (MET) messages for surface to surface trajectories (METB3s) for many decades. It was developed before users had ready access to computers on the battlefield and is normally applied in a manual mode. The later computer MET message (METCM) came into use, as the name implies, after the advent of battlefield computers and continues to be widely used. Some newer artillery MET systems no longer generate METB3s since modern fire control systems use METCMs, and in some NATO nations, the more recent gridded MET message (METGM). Nevertheless, for certain applications and as a backup, there is a requirement to be able to produce a METB3 from a METCM generated locally or transmitted from another artillery MET system. This report briefly discusses a program that converts a METCM into a METB3, which can be applied to specific systems with appropriate modifications, and outlines a modified version for a handheld device. The program applies methods found in available field manuals and NATO publications. Some of the algorithms embodied in the program were extracted
from a similar spreadsheet-based method developed at the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC).},

  abstract = {A well-known path-planning technique for mobile robots or planar aerial vehicles is to use Dubins paths, which are minimum-distance paths between two configurations subject to the constraints of the Dubins car model. An extension of this method to a three-dimensional Dubins airplane model has recently been proposed. This chapter builds on that work showing a complete architecture for implementing Dubins airplane paths on small fixed-wing UAVs. The existing Dubins airplane model is modified to be more consistent with the kinematics of a fixed-wing aircraft. The chapter then shows how a recently proposed vector-field method can be used to design a guidance law that causes the Dubins airplane model to follow straight-line and helical paths. Dubins airplane paths are more complicated than Dubins car paths because of the altitude component. Based on the difference between the altitude of the start and end configurations, Dubins airplane paths can be classified as low, medium, or high altitude gain. While for medium and high altitude gain there are many different Dubins airplane paths, this chapter proposes selecting the path that maximizes the average altitude throughout the maneuver. The proposed architecture is implemented on a six degree-of-freedom Matlab/Simulink simulation of an Aerosonde UAV, and results from this simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.},

Currently, there is no algorithm that can find an optimal solution to the problem. In addition, relaxing the motion constraints and solving the resulting Euclidean TSP (ETSP) provides the only lower bound available for the problem. However, in many problem instances, the lower bound computed by solving the ETSP is far below the cost of the feasible solutions obtained by some well-known algorithms for the DTSP. This article addresses this fundamental issue and presents the first systematic procedure for developing tight lower bounds for the DTSP.},

  title = {Onboard {{Trajectory Generation}} for the {{Unpowered Landing}} of {{Autonomous Reusable Launch Vehicles}}},
  abstract = {Onboard trajectory generation dispenses with the pre-defined trajectories used. in Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) guidance since the early days of the Shuttle era. This shift, enabled by a new breed of algorithms harnessing modern computer power, offers improvements in performance, robustness, operational cost, and safety. This thesis develops a set of algorithms providing onboard trajectory generation for low lift-over-drag gliding RLVs in subsonic flight below 40,000 ft. The NASA/Orbital Sciences X-34 is used as a representative model for which feasible trajectories are designed over a range of initial conditions without human intervention. In addition to being autonomous, the guidance output of the onboard trajectory generator differs from current Shuttle-based approaches, providing a realistic "future history" in a propagated plan, rather than output commands reacting to perceived instantaneous vehicle needs. Hence, this approach serves an enabling role in a larger research effort to develop a next generation guidance system using an integrated control function. To assess feasibility, the onboard trajectory generator is benchmarked against traditional X-34 guidance for a drop test scenario. The results match in basic form, with differences showcasing the autonomous algorithms' preference for maximum robustness. The true strength of the onboard trajectory generator lies in its ability to handle off-nominal conditions. A series of test cases highlight the ability of the algorithms to effectively cope with anomalous initial drop conditions, reach the desired terminal states, and provide maximum late-trajectory robustness. Computation time is sufficiently brief to suggest a real-time application, after straightforward improvements are made.},

  title = {New Methodologies for Onboard Generation of {{TAEM}} Trajectories for Autonomous {{RLVs}}},
  abstract = {Onboard trajectory generation capability greatly increases an autonomous Reusable Launch Vehicle's (RLV) capacity for recovering from unexpected disturbances or anomalous conditions. Such capability dispenses with the routine of pre-defined, mission specific trajectories and contingencies, in use since the early days of the Shuttle. Newer guidance techniques,
employing modern computing power and faster algorithms, can therefore provide savings in both operational cost and design time, while enhancing mission robustness and efficiency. Using the X-34 as a representative RLV model, this paper identifies
weaknesses in the current Terminal Area Energy Management (TAEM) guidance scheme and proposes new trajectory generation methodologies with an approach to adapting them for onboard use. The approach utilizes the full nonlinear equations of motion
to rapidly generate 3 degrees-of-freedom descent trajectories for a low lift-over-drag, gliding RLV from any portion of the TAEM flight regime to the AutoLanding Interface. Full coupling of the
longitudinal and lateral aspects, as well as actual vehicle dynamic capabilities and constraints, result in guidance outputs that are both realistic and flyable. Key technology components are identified and preliminary results and comparisons are presented.},

The resolution presented here was proposed by the IAU Inter-Division Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy and passed by the XXIXth IAU General Assembly in Honolulu. IAU 2015 Resolution B3 adopts a set of nominal solar, terrestrial, and jovian conversion constants for stellar and (exo)planetary astronomy which are defined to be exact SI values. While the nominal constants are based on current best estimates (CBEs; which have uncertainties, are not secularly constant, and are updated regularly using new observations), they should be interpreted as standard values and not as CBEs. IAU 2015 Resolution B3 adopts five solar conversion constants (nominal solar radius, nominal total solar irradiance, nominal solar luminosity, nominal solar effective temperature, and nominal solar mass parameter) and six planetary conversion constants (nominal terrestrial equatorial radius, nominal terrestrial polar radius, nominal jovian equatorial radius, nominal jovian polar radius, nominal terrestrial mass parameter, and nominal jovian mass parameter).},

  title = {The {{Cross}}-{{Entropy Method A Unified Approach}} to {{Combinatorial Optimization}}, {{Monte}}-{{Carlo Simulation}} and {{Machine Learning}}},
  isbn = {978-1-4757-4321-0},
  abstract = {The cross-entropy (CE) method is one of the most significant developments in stochastic optimization and simulation in recent years. This book explains in detail how and why the CE method works. The CE method involves an iterative procedure where each iteration can be broken down into two phases: (a) generate a random data sample (trajectories, vectors, etc.) according to a specified mechanism; (b) update the parameters of the random mechanism based on this data in order to produce a \`\`better'' sample in the next iteration. The simplicity and versatility of the method is illustrated via a diverse collection of optimization and estimation problems. The book is aimed at a broad audience of engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticians and in general anyone, theorist or practitioner, who is interested in fast simulation, including rare-event probability estimation, efficient combinatorial and continuous multi-extremal optimization, and machine learning algorithms. Reuven Y. Rubinstein is the Milford Bohm Professor of Management at the Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management at the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology). His primary areas of interest are stochastic modelling, applied probability, and simulation. He has written over 100 articles and has published five books. He is the pioneer of the well-known score-function and cross-entropy methods. Dirk P. Kroese is an expert on the cross-entropy method. He has published close to 40 papers in a wide range of subjects in applied probability and simulation. He is on the editorial board of Methodology and Computing in Applied Probability and is Guest Editor of the Annals of Operations Research. He has held research and teaching positions at Princeton University and The University of Melbourne, and is currently working at the Department of Mathematics of The University of Queensland. "Rarely have I seen such a dense and straight to the point pedagogical monograph on such a modern subject. This excellent book, on the simulated cross-entropy method (CEM) pioneered by one of the authors (Rubinstein), is very well written..." Computing Reviews, Stochastic Programming November, 2004 "It is a substantial contribution to stochastic optimization and more generally to the stochastic numerical methods theory." Short Book Reviews of the ISI, April 2005 "...I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anybody who is interested in stochastic optimization or simulation-based performance analysis of stochastic systems."

  abstract = {Real-time three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) has attracted much more attention in medical researches because it provides interactive feedback to help clinicians acquire high-quality images as well as timely spatial information of the scanned area and hence is necessary in intraoperative ultrasound examinations. Plenty of publications have been declared to complete the real-time or near real-time visualization of 3D ultrasound using volumetric probes or the routinely used two-dimensional (2D) probes. So far, a review on how to design an interactive system with appropriate processing algorithms remains missing, resulting in the lack of systematic understanding of the relevant technology. In this article, previous and the latest work on designing a real-time or near real-time 3D ultrasound imaging system are reviewed. Specifically, the data acquisition techniques, reconstruction algorithms, volume rendering methods, and clinical applications are presented. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art approaches are discussed in detail.},

The book is intended for students, mathematicians, and those who apply the techniques of optimal control in their research. Our intention is to give a broad, yet relatively deep, concise and coherent introduction to the subject. We have dedicated an entire chapter for examples. We have dealt with the examples pointing out the mathematical issues that one needs to address. The first six chapters can provide enough material for an introductory course in optimal control theory governed by differential equations. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 could be covered with more or less details in the mathematical issues depending on the mathematical background of the students. For students with background in functional analysis and measure theory Chapter 7 can be added. Chapter 7 is a more mathematically rigorous version of the material in Chapter 6. We have included material dealing with problems governed by integrodifferential and delay equations. We have given a unified treatment of bounded state problems governed by ordinary, integrodifferential, and delay systems. We have also added material dealing with the Hamilton-Jacobi Theory. This material sheds light on the mathematical details that accompany the material in Chapter 6"--},

  title = {Modeling and Simulation of Heat Source Trajectories through Phase-Change Materials},
  abstract = {The modeling and simulation of heat source trajectories through phase-change materials is a relevant problem both for space exploration and for terrestrial climate research, among other fields. In space, the DLR and NASA are both interested in exploring beneath the surfaces of icy moons, primarily Enceladus and Europa, where conditions may alloy for extraterrestrial life. On Earth, unique sub-glacial aquatic ecosystems offer potential for geo-biological discoveries. Unfortunately, existing ice-drilling technology is dirty and cumbersome. Melting probes are a clean and compact alternative technology which use heaters to melt through the ice. A melting probe's trajectory can be controlled with differential heating. Successful trajectory control requires advancements not only in the modeling and simulation of the ambient dynamics, but also of the probe's coupled rigid body dynamics. Fundamentally, the rigid body dynamics can be modeled by the equations of motion; but this approach is prohibitively complex. This work proposes an approach which exploits that the motion of the probe is driven by contact with the evolving liquid-solid interface. From this perspective, an energy minimization problem is formulated. The general mathematical problem is formulated as two split operators, respectively for the rigid body dynamics and the ambient dynamics. These operators are coupled with feasibility constraints which ensure that the probe does not penetrate the solid. Concrete examples are shown both for the energy minimization problem and for the unsteady ambient dynamics. Finally, an algorithm is presented for the temporal coupling of the split operators, which is implemented using Python and C++. Example trajectories are shown, including the dynamic response of the probe velocity to a rapid change in the heat flux.},

In most applications however, this technique is restricted to equal thermophysical properties of solid and liquid phases. In this paper, an enhanced formulation based on the enthalpy-porosity method is proposed where the different thermophysical properties between the two phases can be easily taken into account. Accurate temporal and spatial discretizations are also presented for solving the proposed formulation. Numerical simulations on pure gallium melting and a comparison between experimental and numerical results for water solidification are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed model and numerical methodology},
